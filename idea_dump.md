# Idea Dump

This doc contains cool project ideas I believe people would use

## Motivation
Project Based learning is a great way to learn new concepts as applying your knowledge to solve problems and deliver an incremental positive impact is the most satisfying feeling in the world. Every human does have the power to make positive change in this world (no matter how small nor big). It's easy to just live life passively, but if you want to deliver purpose and leave a legacy that future generations could benefit from, why not try to deliver some good. I'm assuming that the audience for this doc are people who are venturing in the software engineer track or are aspiring software engineers and related fields as well. 

In the software engineering track (or broader computer science field), anyone can come up with an idea, but what sets you apart is the ability to execute and deliver. That's what's more important (on top of being a good team player and communicator). You can totally build some solutions/apps relating to these project ideas solo, but it'd be much cooler if you can get a team of friends, peers together who are invested in the vision and build something together. You not only get to practice being a good communicator, but also you can make friends as well :)

## Tips for coming up with good ideas (taken from my understanding and what I've gathered across multiple medium blogs and stuff)

* Part of coming up with a good idea is identifying the right problems. We can always overengineer solutions to basic things, but keep your eye on solving the right problems

* What are pain points that you face in your daily life? Like, what gives you that feeling of "I'm so annoyed when I have to do X, Y, Z. Why can't there be an app or automated way to do it?"

* What gives you the feeling of "Wouldn't it be so great if X technology/app can have Y feature?". Why not build that out?

If you guys do take an idea from this doc and build out a project, please credit @karkir0003 for it! These ideas are listed in no-particular order. Happy building :construction_worker:
